## To-Do List
A few times every year, I make a list of household taks that needs to be done. I wanted to use this idea for my project. Currently in my life, I am working full-time as a teacher, aside from doing the Flatiron flex program for Software Engineering. My girlfriend and I are also expecting our first child together in December. So to say my time is limited is an understatement. So I came up with a list. Although it isn't perfect, I hope to add to it as I learn more and continue throughout the program. The three event listeners I have included are a click button, where you can add an ID#, task title, category, notes for a new todo. For the 2nd event listener, I added a click feature that zooms in on the picture when you click it, then when you mouseover to the side it goes back to normal. The 3rd event is in the text box where you add new todos. When you mouse over each box it will clear the headers for you to type. Then you can start adding todos.
